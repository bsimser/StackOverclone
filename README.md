# StackOverclone

An ASP.NET MVC tutorial project for building a community like Stack Overflow with MVC

--

Ever wonder how to build a Q&A site like Stack Overflow? When it comes to answering almost any kind of question, one of the best places on the Internet to go is Stack Overflow. Users up and down vote questions and answers and lend credibility and confidence to finding good information.

This MVC application clones the orginal sites functionality and provides the ability for users that:

* Read and search questions and answers
* List all tags, users, and filter and sort answers
* Sign up using a username/password or use an OpenID/OAuth2 security provider (like Github, Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.)
* Lets logged in users ask new questions
* Lets logged in users vote questions and answers up or down
* Lets logged in users and authors of a question mark an answer as "correct"
* Lets logged in users gain (or loose) reputation points

This is not meant to be a site to compete with Stack Overflow, it's merely an open source project and set of tutorials that show you how you might build a Q&A site that offers the same functionality of Stack Overflow. The look and feel is a clone of the original site just so you can compare and see how this codebase implements that functionality. How Stack Overflow actually does it is probably way better than anything I could do, so just enjoy.
